## PowerBi Projects

### Step-1:Data Collection:
#### Databases: Connect to SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or other database systems using Power BI's built-in connectors.
#### Excel Files: Import data from Excel spreadsheets. This is useful for small to medium-sized datasets stored locally or on OneDrive.
#### Cloud Services: Use connectors for cloud services like Azure, Google Analytics, Salesforce, etc., to import data directly.

### Step-2: Data Cleaning :
#### Handling Missing Values:
1) Replace missing values with appropriate substitutes (e.g., mean, median, zero, or a specific value).
2) Remove rows or columns with a high percentage of missing data if they cannot be reasonably imputed.

#### Removing Duplicates:
1) Identify and remove duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

#### Fixing Inconsistencies:
1) Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, text casing) and correct any errors or inconsistencies in the data.


### Step-3:Transform Data
#### Using Power Query Editor:
1) Shape and transform data by adding new columns, merging queries, pivoting data, and more.
